## Abstract
Antibiotic resistant pathogens are a major threat to global health. Emerging superbugs are rapidly becoming resistant to available antibiotics, while the discovery of new antibiotics is falling behind. Phage therapy offers a potential solution that has achieved remarkable successes. However, it is limited by the number of pathogens that can be targeted by available natural phages. To address this limitation, we aim to increase the range of phage specificities. Host specificity is influenced by the affinity of the phageâ€™s binding protein to the bacterial surface. We developed a system that integrates random codons in phage genomes at any locus of interest. This allows for the formation of phage libraries with novel binding proteins that alter the host spectrum. Our bioreactor selects and evolves the best variants. The observed phage-host interactions can be used to further improve library design. Our system could be the basis for personalized treatment of bacterial infections. 
We are currently testing three approaches to generate these libraries.
* Yeast assembly: a plasmid containing the T7 genome is assembled by homologous recombination in yeast and a library of randomized oligos is inserted into variable region of tail fiber protein.
* Recombineering: A randomised sequence present on a plasmid is inserted into the tail fiber gene in vivo by using E. coli's homologous recombination machinery.
* In vitro: The tail fiber variable regions are ligated to the T7 genome in vitro by Gibson assembly.
